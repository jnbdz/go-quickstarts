Make your Go code go faster! Obviously!

- **Decrease response time**: The amount of request time in total.
- **Decreased latency**: The lag experienced in a system from when an action is initiated to when its impact is observed is referred to as the delay between cause and effect.
- **Increased throughput**: The processed rate of data.
- **Higher scalability**: In a systemthe increased of work that can be processed.

## The Big O notation
- [Big O notation | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)
- The limiting behavior of a function based on the size of the inputs
- Used to explain how efficient algorithms are in comparison to one another
- How well an algorithm will scale
- Measuring of algorithms
